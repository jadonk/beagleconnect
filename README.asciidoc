= BeagleConnect™

BeagleConnect™ is a revolutionary technology virtually eliminating low-level software development for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things[IoT] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_internet_of_things[IIoT] applications, such as building automation, factory automation, home automation, and scientific data acquisition. While numerous IoT and IIoT solutions available today provide massive software libraries for microcontrollers footnote:[Complexity can be seen by exploring https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/category/sensors/[Arduino sensor libraries]] supporting a limited body of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor[sensors], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuator[actuators] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_(distance_amplifying_instrument)[indicators] as well as libraries for communicating over various networks, BeagleConnect simply eliminates the need for these libraries by shifting the burden into the most massive and collaborative software project of all time, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel[Linux kernel].

image::graphics/BeagleConnect-Freedom-C5-Boards.png[]

These are the tools used to automate things in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection_system[scientific data collection], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science[data science], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics[mechatronics], and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things[IoT].

BeagleConnect™ technology solves: 

* The need to write software to add a large set of diverse devices to your system, 
* The need to maintain the software with security updates, 
* The need to rapidly prototype using off-the-shelf software and hardware without wiring, 
* The need to connect to devices using long-range, low-power wireless, and 
* The need to produce high-volume custom hardware cost-optimized for your requirements.

= BeagleConnect™ experience

BeagleConnect™ provides a scalable experience for interacting with the physical world.

NOTE: The term _BeagleConnect™_ refers to a technology comprising of a family of boards, a collection of Linux kernel drivers, microcontroller firmware, a communication protocol, and system-level integration to automation software tools. More specific terms will be applied in the architecture details. The term is also used here to represent the experience introduced to users through the initial _BeagleConnect™ Freedom_ product consisting of a board and case which ships programmed and ready to be used.

For scientists, we are integrating https://jupyter.org/[Jupyter Notebook] with the data streams from any of hundreds of sensor options, including https://www.mikroe.com/click/sensors/force[vibration], https://www.mikroe.com/click/sensors/gas[gas detection], https://www.mikroe.com/click/sensors/biometrics[biometrics] and https://www.mikroe.com/click/sensors[more]. These data streams can be stored in simple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[data files] or processed and visualized.

#TODO: provide images demonstrating Jupyter Notebook visualization

For embedded systems developers, data is easily extrated using the standard https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/iio/index.html[IIO] interface provided by the https://kernel.org[Linux kernel] running on the gateway using any of hundreds of programming languages and environments, without writing a line of microcontroller firmware. The Linux environment provides opportunities for high-level remote management using tools like https://balena.io[Balena] with applications deployed in https://docker.io[Docker] containers.

#TODO: provide image illustrating remote management

The hardware and software are fully open source, providing for scalability and a lack of vendor lock-in.

For DevOps...

For home automaters, integration into https://webthings.io[WebThings]...

#TODO: think a bit more about this section with some feedback from Cathy.

== BeagleConnect™ Freedom
image::graphics/BeagleConnect-Freedom-C5-HandPhoto.png[]

#TODO: provide image of BeagleConnect™ Freedom in case with a hand for size perspective

IMPORTANT: _BeagleConnect™ Freedom_ enables wirelessly adding new device nodes and is targeted to cost initially around US$20 with a roadmap to variants as low as US$1.

The initial _BeagleConnect™ Freedom_ production release will: 

* Support at least 100 https://elinux.org/Mikrobus[mikroBUS]-based https://mikroe.com/click[Click boards from Mikroelectronika], 
* Work with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy[Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)]-enabled Linux computers at 2.4GHz, 
* Work with long-range sub-1GHz https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4[IEEE 802.15.4 wireless connections] at 500 meters with data rates of 1kbps, and 
* Work with a low-cost BeagleBoard.org Linux https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer[single-board computer (SBC)] as a `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` and
  work with at least 10 other `BeagleConnect™ node devices` each supporting 2 add-on sensor, actuator or indicator devices.

Future releases will be collaborated with the community, evolve dynamically, and contain additional functionality. The goal is to support over 500 add-on devices within the first year after the initial release.

[[story]]
= The Story Behind BeagleConnect™ 

[[long-background]]
== The Long Background
There are many stories behind BeagleConnect™, mine is just one of them. It begins
with my mom teaching me about computers. She told me I could anything I wanted
with ours, as long as I didn't open the case. This was the late-70s/early-80s, so
all she needed to do was put her https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk[floppy disk]
away and there wasn't risk of me damaging the family photo album or her ability to
do her work the next day. I listened and learned from her the basics of programming, but
it wasn't long before I wanted to take the computer apart. 

=== Getting Started in Electronics
Exploring http://www.forrestmims.org/[Getting Started in Electronics] satisfied my itch for quite a while. Eventually, I got a Commodore 64 and began connecting voice synthesizer ICs to it. My interest in computers and electronics flourished into an electrical engineering degree and a long career in the semiconductor industry.

Over this time, I've become more and more alarmed with the progress of technology. Now, to be clear, I love technology. I love innovation and invention. It is just that some things have evolved in a sort of tunnel-vision, without bringing everyone along.

=== But, what about keyboard users?
As graphical user interfaces and mice took over computers, they rapidly became almost unusable by my mom. She typed well, but the dexterity to move a mouse aluded her. To satisfy the need to interact with locations on the screen, she adopted using a joystick and her productivity came to a crawl. How is it that such assumptions could be made impacting *all* computer users without any thoughtful provisions for what already worked?

= Architecture

[[beagleconnect-leash]]
== BeagleConnect™ Freedom
_BeagleConnect™ Freedom_ is based on the https://www.ti.com/product/CC1352R[TI CC1352] and is the first available BeagleConnect™ solution. It implements:

* `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` function for Sub-GHz 802.15.4 long-range wireless
* `BeagleConnect™ node device` function for Bluetooth Low-Energe (BLE) and Sub-GHz 802.15.4 long range wireless
* USB-based serial console and firmware updates
* 2x https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus[mikroBUS sockets] with `BeagleConnect™ protocol support`


[[what-is-new]]
== What makes BeagleConnect™ new and different?

IMPORTANT: BeagleConnect™ solves IoT in a different and better way than any previous
solution.

[[the-device-interface-software-is-already-done]]
=== The device interface software is already done

BeagleConnect™ uses the collaboratively developed Linux kernel to contain the intelligence required to speak to these devices (sensors, actuators, and indicators), rather than relying on writing code on a
microcontroller specific to these devices. Some existing solutions rely on large libraries of microcontroller code, but the integration of communications, maintenance of the library with a limited set of
developer resources and other constraints to be explained later make
those other solutions less suitable for rapid prototyping than
BeagleConnect™.

Linux presents these devices abstractly in ways that are
self-descriptive. Add an accelerometer to the system and you are
automatically fed a stream of force values in standard units. Add a
temperature sensor and you get it back in standard units again. Same for sensing magnetism, proximity, color, light, frequency, orientation, or multitudes of other inputs. Indicators, such as LEDs and displays, are similarly abstracted with a few other kernel subsystems and more advanced actuators with and without feedback control are in the process of being developed and standardized. In places where proper Linux kernel drivers exist, no new specialized code needs to be created for the devices.

IMPORTANT: _Bottom line_: For hundreds of devices, users won't have to write a single line of code to add them their systems. The automation code they do write can be extremely simple, done with graphical tools or in any language they want. Maintenance of the code is centralized in a small reusable set of microcontroller firmware and the Linux kernel, which is highly peer reviewed under a https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Linux_-_Governance[highly-regarded governance model].

[[on-going-maintenance]]
=== On-going maintenance

Because there isn't code specific to any given network-of-devices
configuration, we can all leverage the same software code base. This
means that when someone fixes an issue in either BeagleConnect™ firmware or the Linux kernel, you benefit from the fixes. The source for BeagleConnect™ firmware is also submitted to the https://www.zephyrproject.org/[Zephyr Project] upstream, further increasing the user base. Additionally, we will maintain stable branches of the software and provide mechanisms for updating firmware on BeagleConnect™ hardware. With a single, relatively small firmware load, the potential for bugs is kept low. With large user base, the potential for discovering and resolving bugs is high.

[[rapid-prototyping-without-wiring]]
=== Rapid prototyping without wiring

BeagleConnect™ utilizes the https://elinux.org/Mikrobus[mikroBUS
standard]. The mikroBUS standard interface is flexible enough for almost any typical sensor or indicator with hundreds of devices available.

NOTE: Currently, we have support in the Linux kernel for a bit over 100 _Click_ mikroBUS add-on boards from Mikroelektronika and are working with Mikroelektronika on a updated version of the specification for these boards to self-identify. Further, eventually the vast majority of over 800 currently available _Click_ mikroBUS add-on boards will be supported as well as the hundreds of compliant boards developed every year.

[[long-range-low-power-wireless]]
=== Long-range, low-power wireless

_BeagleConnect™ Freedom_ wireless hardware is built around a
http://www.ti.com/product/CC1352R[TI CC1352] multiprotocol and multi-band Sub-1 GHz and 2.4-GHz wireless microcontroller (MCU). CC1352R includes a 48-MHz Arm® Cortex®-M4F processor, 352KB Flash, 256KB ROM, 8KB Cache SRAM, 80KB of ultra-low leakage SRAM, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_programming[Over-the-Air] upgrades (OTA).

[[full-customization-possible]]
=== Full customization possible

BeagleConnect™ utilizes https://www.oshwa.org/definition/[open source
hardware] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software[open
source software], making it possible to optimize hardware and software
implementations and sourcing to meet end-product requirements. BeagleConnect™ is meant to enable rapid-prototyping and not to necessarily satisfy any particular end-product's requirements, but with full considerations for go-to-market needs.

Each BeagleBoard.org BeagleConnect™ solution will be:

* Readily available for over 10 years, 
* Built with fully
open source software with submissions to mainline Linux and Zephyr repositories to aide in support and porting, 
* Built with fully open source and non-restrictive hardware design including schematic, bill-of-materials, layout, and manufacturing files (with only the BeagleBoard.org logo removed due to licensing restrictions of our brand), 
* Built with parts where at least a compatible part is available from worldwide distributors in any quantity, 
* Built with design and manufacturing partners able to help scale derivative designs, 
* Based on a security model using public/private keypairs that can be replaced to secure your own network, and 
* Fully FCC/CE certified.

[[enable-a-linux-host-with-beagleconnect]]
=== Enable a Linux host with BeagleConnect™

image:https://github.com/beagleboard/beagleconnect/blob/master/docs/ProvStep1.PNG?raw=true[Provisioning Step 1]

Log into a host system running Linux that is BeagleConnect™ enabled. Enable a Linux host with BeagleConnect™ by plugging a `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` into it's USB port. You'll also want to have a `BeagleConnect™ node device` with a sensor, actuator or indicator device connected.

NOTE: _BeagleConnect™ Freedom_ can act as either a `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` or a
`BeagleConnect™ node device`.

IMPORTANT: The Linux host will need to run the `BeagleConnect™ management software`, most of which is incorporated into the Linux kernel. Support will be provided for BeagleBoard and BeagleBone boards, x86 hosts, and Raspberry Pi.

#TODO: Clean up images#

[[connect-host-and-device]]
=== Connect host and device

image:https://github.com/beagleboard/beagleconnect/blob/master/docs/ProvStep2.PNG?raw=true[Provisioning Step 2]

Initiate a connection between the host and devices by pressing the discovery button(s).

[[device-data-shows-up-as-files]]
=== Device data shows up as files

image:https://github.com/beagleboard/beagleconnect/blob/master/docs/ProvStep3.PNG?raw=true[Provisioning Step 3]

New streams of self-describing data show up on the host system using native device drivers.

High-level applications, like `Node-RED`, can directly read/write these high-level data streams (including data-type information) to Internet-based https://mqtt.org/[MQTT] brokers, live dashboards, or other logical operations without requiring any sensor-specific coding. Business logic can be applied using simple if-this-then-that style operations or be made as complex as desired using virtually any programming language or environment.

#TODO: Actually, Node-RED will make these show up automatically as streams.#

[[components]]
== Components

[horizontal]
BeagleConnect™ enabled host:: Linux computer, possibly single-board computer (SBC), with `BeagleConnect™ management software` and `BeagleConnect™ gateway function`. `BeagleConnect™ gateway function` can be provided by a `BeagleConnect™ compatible interface` or by connecting a `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` over USB.

+
NOTE: If the Linux host has BLE, the BeagleConnect™ is optional for short distances
+

BeagleConnect™ Freedom:: Board, case, and wireless MCU with `Zephyr` based firmware for acting as either a `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` or `BeagleConnect™ node device`.
* In `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` mode:
** Provides long-range, low-power wireless communications,
** Connects with the `host` via USB and an associated Linux kernel driver, and
** Is powered by the USB connector.
* In `BeagleConnect™ node device` mode:
** Powered by a battery or USB connector
** Provides 2 mikroBUS connectors for connecting any of hundreds of https://bbb.io/click[Click Board] mikroBUS add-on devices
** Provides new Linux host controllers for SPI, I2C, UART, PWM, ADC, and GPIO with interrupts via `Greybus`

BeagleConnect™ gateway device:: Provides a `BeagleConnect™ compatible interface` to a host. This could be a built-in interface device or one connected over USB. _BeagleConnect™ Freedom_ can provide this function.

BeagleConnect™ node device:: Utilizes a `BeagleConnect™ compatible interface` and #TODO#

BeagleConnect™ compatible interface:: Immediate plans are to support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4, and Sub-GHz IEEE 802.15.4 _wireless_ interfaces. A built-in BLE interface is suitable for this at short range, whereas IEEE 802.15.4 is typically significantly better at long ranges. Other _wired_ interfaces, such as _CAN_ and _RS-485_, are being considered for future `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` and `BeagleConnect™ node device` designs.

Greybus:: #TODO#

#TODO: Find a place for the following notes:

** The device interfaces get exposed to the host via Greybus BRIDGED_PHY protocol
** The I2C bus is probed for a an identifier EEPROM and appropriate device drivers are loaded on the host
** Unsupported Click Boards connected are exposed via userspace drivers on the host for development

[[whats-different]]
== What's different

So, in summary, what is so different with this approach?

* No microcontroller code development is required by users
* Userspace drivers make rapid prototyping really easy
* Kernel drivers makes the support code collaborative parts of the Linux kernel, rather than cut-and-paste

[[development]]
= Develop for BeagleConnect™ Freedom with Zephyr

Developing directly in Zephyr will not be ultimately required for end-users who won't touch the firmware running on BeagleConnect™ Freedom and will instead use the BeagleConnect™ Greybus functionality, but is important for early adopters as well as people looking to extend the functionality of the open source design. If you are one of those people, this is a good place to get started.

[[equipment]]

2. Load this image to a microSD card using a tool like https://www.balena.io/etcher/[Etcher].
3. Insert the microSD card into the Green Gateway.
4. Power BeagleBone Green Gateway via the 12V barrel jack.

#TODO: describe how to know it is working

== Log into BeagleBone Green Gateway

These instructions assume an x86_64 computer runing Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS, but any computer can be used to connect to your BeagleBone Green Gateway.

1. Log onto the Seeed BeagleBone® Green Gateway using `ssh`.
** We need IP address, Username, and Password to connect to the device.
** The default IP for the BeagleBone hardware is `192.168.7.2`
** The default Username is `debian` & Password is `temppwd`
** To connect you can simply type `$ ssh debian@192.168.7.2` and when asked for password just type `temppwd`.
** Congratulations, You are now connected to the device!
2. Connect to the https://forum.beagleboard.org/t/debian-11-x-bullseye-monthly-snapshots/31280[WiFi]
** Execute `sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf` and provide the password `temppwd` to edit the configuration file for the WiFi connection.
** Now edit the the file (shown below) under the `network={ ... }` section you can set you `ssid` (WiFi name) and `psk` (Wifi Password).

    ctrl_interface=DIR=/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1
    #country=IN
    network={
            ssid="WiFi Name"
            psk="WiFi Password"
    }
    
** Now save the file with `CTRL+O` and exit with `CTRL+X`.
** Check if the connection is established by executing `$ ping 8.8.8.8` you should see something like shown below.

    debian@BeagleBone:~$ ping 8.8.8.8
    PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=118 time=10.5 ms
    64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=118 time=5.72 ms
    64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=118 time=6.13 ms
    64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=118 time=6.11 ms
    ...
    
** If everything goes will, you are ready to update your system and install new applications for beagleconnect.

NOTE: If you are facing some issue during boot then you can try debuging the boot session with a USB to serial interface cable such as those made by https://www.digikey.com/short/cfjmdbdd[FTDI] plugged into J10 with the black wire of the FTDI cable toward the Ethernet connector. Application like putty/mimicom can be used to make the connection estibleshment procedure easy.

To understand a bit more about how the BeagleConnect™ Greybus stack is being built, this section helps describe the development currently in progress and the principles of operation.

[[background]]
== Background

image:https://github.com/beagleboard/beagleconnect/blob/master/docs/SoftwareProp.PNG?raw=true[Software
Proposition] BeagleConnect™ uses Greybus and updated Click Boards with
identifiers to eliminate the need to add and manually configure devices
added onto the Linux system.

[[high-level]]
=== High-level

* For Linux nerds: Think of BeagleConnect™ as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN[6LoWPAN] over
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4[802.15.4]-based
https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2015/talks/an-introduction-to-greybus/[Greybus]
(instead of Unipro as used by Project Ara), where every BeagleConnect™
board shows up as new SPI, I2C, UART, PWM, ADC, and GPIO controllers
that can now be probed to load drivers for the sensors or whatever is
connected to them. (Proof of concept of Greybus over TCP/IP:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H50pv-4YXw)
* For MCU folks: Think of BeagleConnect™ as a
https://github.com/firmata/protocol[Firmata]-style firmware load that
exposes the interfaces for remote access over a secured wireless
network. However, instead of using host software that knows how to speak
the Firmata protocol, the Linux kernel speaks the slightly similar
Greybus protocol to the MCU and exposes the device generically to users
using a Linux kernel driver. Further, the Greybus protocol is spoken
over https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN[6LoWPAN] on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4[802.15.4].

= BeagleConnect™ Greybus demo using BeagleConnect™ Freedom
BeagleConnect™ Freedom runs a subGHz IEEE 802.15.4 network. This BeagleConnect™ Greybus demo shows how to interact with GPIO, I2C and mikroBUS add-on boards remotely connected over a BeagleConnect™ Freedom.

This section starts with the steps required to use
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux[Linux] embedded computer (https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/BeagleBone-Green-Gateway/[BeagleBone Green Gateway]) and the
https://lwn.net/Articles/715955/[Greybus] protocol, over an IEEE
802.15.4 wireless link, to blink an LED on a
https://zephyrproject.org[Zephyr] device.

== Introduction

=== Why??

Good question. Blinking an LED is kind of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program[Hello, World]
of the hardware community. In this case, we’re less interested in the
mechanics of switching a GPIO to drive some current through an LED and
more interested in how that happens with the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things[Internet of Things
(IoT)].

There are several existing network and application layers that are
driven by corporate heavyweights and industry consortiums, but
relatively few that are community driven and, more specifically, even
fewer that have the ability to integrate so tightly with the Linux
kernel.

The goal here is to provide a community-maintained, developer-friendly,
and open-source protocol for the Internet of Things using the Greybus
Protocol, and blinking an LED using Greybus is the simplest
proof-of-concept for that. All that is required is a reliable transport.

=== History

There are a few technologies at the core of this demonstration, and far
too much background information to describe adequately here, so they are
simply listed below for brevity:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Ara[Project Ara]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6[IPv6] (via
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN[6LoWPAN])
* https://zephyrproject.org[Zephyr] support for
https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/reference/networking/ieee802154.html[IEEE
802.15.4]
* https://youtu.be/UzRq8jAHAxU[Greybus] originally from
https://youtu.be/UzRq8jAHAxU[Project Ara]
* https://youtu.be/7H50pv-4YXw[Using Greybus for IoT]

In short, Greybus is an application layer protocol that can be described
as a ``bus transport'' in that it conveys bus-specific messages back and
forth between Linux and a connected device. The physical bus is attached
to the connected device, which could be running Linux or a variety of
Real-Time Operating Systems. Meanwhile, on the Linux side, a virtual bus
is created corresponding to the physical bus on the connected device. To
the user, this virtual bus (be it /dev/gpiochip0, /dev/i2c5, etc)
appears and functions exactly the same. Greybus is the protocol used to
exchange bus-specific messages and data between Linux and the connected
device.

The major advantage there is that drivers can be well maintained in
Linux rather than buried in microcontroller firmware.

Greybus currently supports several busses, including:

* USB
* I2C
* GPIO
* PWM
* SPI
* UART
* SDIO
* Camera (V4L)
* LED (with various programmability)
* AUDIO (I2S)

#TODO: The agenda for the above falls a bit short of BeagleConnect

=== Hardware requirements

See the <<Equipment>> section for hardware requirements.

== Running the demo

#TODO: Fill in some details for new embedded Linux users

#TODO: Arrange demo in order of _fast success_ to _greater understanding_

=== Install the latest software image

Download and install the Debian Linux operating system image for the
Seeed BeagleBone® Green Gateway host.

1. Download the special mikroBUS/Greybus BeagleBoard.org Debian image from
https://rcn-ee.net/rootfs/debian-mikrobus-armhf/[here]. 
Pick the most recent directory and select the file beginning with *bone-* and ending with *.img.xz*.
Today that file is *bone-debian-11.2-iot-mikrobus-armhf-2022-03-04-4gb.img.xz*.
2. Load this image to a microSD card using a tool like https://www.balena.io/etcher/[Etcher].
3. Insert the microSD card into the Green Gateway.
4. Power the Green Gateway via the 12V barrel jack.
5. Log onto the Seeed BeagleBone® Green Gateway using `ssh` or, with a serial to USB cable such as those made by FTDI[https://www.digikey.com/short/cfjmdbdd] plugged into J10 with the black wire of the FTDI cable toard the Ethernet connector.  To use `ssh`, you will have to know the Green Gateway's IP address that can be found from your router.
6. (If using WiFi) Use the `connmanctl` tool to gain an Internet connection.

=== Flash BeagleConnect™ Freedom *gateway* device

Comamnd-line instructions below are to be issued into the BeagleBone® Green Gateway terminal, either via `ssh` or the serial console.

On the newly imaged BeagleBone® Green Gateway board:

1. Connect (or reconnect) a BeagleConnect™ Freedom board over USB
2. `cc2538-bsl.py /usr/share/beagleconnect/cc1352/wpanusb_beagleconnect.bin /dev/ttyACM0` 
footnote:[If the cc2538-bs1.py command fails, see Flashing via a Linux Host below]
3. After it finishes programming successfully, reconnect the BeagleConnect Freedom board over USB
4. Test that the driver loaded and is talking to the newly added gateway radio
+
```
debian@beaglebone:~$ iwpan wpan0 info

        max_csma_backoffs 4
        lbt 0
        ackreq_default 0
```

=== Test gateway using pre-programmed node firmware

By default, the beta boards ship with a debug sensor broadcast per https://gist.github.com/Pillar1989/c579b789e38e856cde16e77345932ac4[sensortest-main.c]. You can use this to further test your gateway.

1. Power a BeagleConnect Freedom that has not yet been programmed via a USB power source, not
the BeagleBone Green Gateway. You'll hear a click every 1-2 seconds along with seeing 4 of the
LEDs turn off and on.
2. In an isolated terminal window, `sudo beagleconnect-start-gateway`
3. `sensortest-rx.py`

Every 1-2 minutes, you should see something like:
```
('fe80::3111:7a22:4b:1200%lowpan0', 52213, 0, 13)  '2l:7.79;'
('fe80::3111:7a22:4b:1200%lowpan0', 52213, 0, 13)  '4h:43.75;4t:23.11;'
```

The value after "2l:" is the amount of light in lux. The value after "4h:" is the relative humidity and after "4t:" is the temperature in Celcius.

=== Flash BeagleConnect™ Freedom *node* device with Greybus firmware

#TODO: How can we add a step in here to show the network is connected without needing `gbridge` to be fully functional?

Do this from the BeagleBone® Green Gateway board that was previously used to program the BeagleConnect™ Freedom *gateway* device:

1. Disconnect the BeagleConnect™ Freedom *gateway* device
2. Connect a new BeagleConnect™ Freedom board via USB
3. `sudo systemctl stop lowpan.service`
4. `cc2538-bsl.py /usr/share/beagleconnect/cc1352/greybus_mikrobus_beagleconnect.bin /dev/ttyACM0`
footnote:[If the cc2538-bs1.py command fails, see Flashing via a Linux Host below]
5. After it finishes programming successfully, disconnect the BeagleConnect Freedom node device
6. Power the newly programmed BeagleConnect Freedom *node* device from an alternate USB power source
7. Reconnect the BeagleConnect Freedom *gateway* device to the BeagleBone Green Gateway
8. `sudo systemctl start lowpan.service`
9. `sudo beagleconnect-start-gateway`

```sh
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo beagleconnect-start-gateway

#TODO: update the below for the built-in sensors

#TODO: can we also handle the case where these sensors are included and recommend them? Same firmware?

#TODO: the current demo is for the built-in sensors, not the Click boards mentioned below

Currently only a limited number of add-on boards have been tested to work over Greybus, simple add-on
boards without interrupt requirement are the ones that work currently.  The example is for
Air Quality 2 Click and Weather Click attached to the mikroBUS ports on the device side.

/var/log/gbridge will have the gbridge log, and if the mikroBUS port has been instantiated successfully the kernel log will show the devices probe messages:

#TODO: bring in the GPIO toggle and I2C explorations for greater understanding

=== Flashing via a Linux Host
If flashing the Freedom board via the BeagleBone fails here's a trick you can try to flash from a Linux host.

Use `sshfs` to mount the Bone's files on the Linux host.  This assumes the Bone is plugged in the the USB
and appears at `192.168.7.2`:

```
host$ cd
host$ sshfs 192.168.7.2:/ bone
host$ cd bone; ls
bin   dev  home    lib         media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
boot  etc  ID.txt  lost+found  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var
host$ ls /dev/ttyACM*
/dev/ttyACM1

```
The Bone's files now appear as local files.  Notice there is already a
`/dev/ACM` appearing.  Now plug the Connect into the Linux host's USB port
and run the command again.

```
host$ ls /dev/ttyACM*
/dev/ttyACM0  /dev/ttyACM1

```

The `/dev/ttyASM` that just appeared is the one associated with the Connect.
In my case it's `/dev/ttyACM0`.  That's what I'll use in this example.

Now change directories to where the binaries are and load:

```
host$ cd ~/bone/usr/share/beagleconnect/cc1352;ls
greybus_mikrobus_beagleconnect.bin     sensortest_beagleconnect.dts
greybus_mikrobus_beagleconnect.config  wpanusb_beagleconnect.bin
greybus_mikrobus_beagleconnect.dts     wpanusb_beagleconnect.config
sensortest_beagleconnect.bin           wpanusb_beagleconnect.dts
sensortest_beagleconnect.config

host$ ~/bone/usr/bin/cc2538-bsl.py sensortest_beagleconnect.bin /dev/ttyACM0

```

Now you are ready to continue the instructions above after the cc2528 command.

==== Trying for different add-on boards

See https://github.com/vaishnav98/greybus-for-zephyr/tree/mikrobus#trying-out-different-add-on-boardsdevices-over-mikrobus[mikroBUS over Greybus] for trying out the same example for different mikroBUS add-on boards/ on-board devices.

== Observe the node device

Connect BeagleConnect Freedom node device to an Ubuntu laptop to observe the Zephyr console.

=== Console (`tio`)

In order to see diagnostic messages or to run certain commands on the
Zephyr device we will require a terminal open to the device console. In
this case, we use https://tio.github.io/[tio] due how its usage
simplifies the instructions.

==== Install `tio`

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install -y tio
----

==== Run `tio`

Now, we’ll open a terminal to Zephyr using the newly created setup with
the command below.

[source,console]
----
tio /dev/ttyACM0
----

IMPORTANT: To exit `tio` (later), enter `ctrl+t, q`.

=== The Zephyr Shell

After flashing, you should observe the something matching the following
output in `tio`.

....

....

The line beginning with `+++***+++` is the Zephyr boot banner.

Lines beginning with a timestamp of the form `[H:m:s.us]` are Zephyr
kernel messages.

Lines beginning with `uart:~$` indicates that the Zephyr shell is
prompting you to enter a command.

From the informational messages shown, we observe the following.

* Zephyr is configured with the following
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address#IPv6[link-local IPv6
address] `fe80::3177:a11c:4b:1200`
* It is listening for (both) TCP and UDP traffic on port 4242

However, what the log messages do _not_ show (which will come into play
later), are 2 critical pieces of information:

1. *The RF Channel*: As you
may have guessed, IEEE 802.15.4 devices are only able to communicate
with each other if they are using the same frequency to transmit and
recieve data. This information is part of the Physical Layer.
2. The
https://www.silabs.com/community/wireless/proprietary/knowledge-base.entry.html/2019/10/04/connect_tutorial6-ieee802154addressing-rapc[PAN
identifier]: IEEE 802.15.4 devices are only be able to communicate with
one another if they use the _same_ PAN ID. This permits multiple
networks (PANs) on the same frequency. This information is part of the
Data Link Layer.

If we type `help` in the shell and hit _Enter_, we’re prompted with the
following:

[source,console]
----
Please press the <Tab> button to see all available commands.
You can also use the <Tab> button to prompt or auto-complete all commands or its subcommands.
You can try to call commands with <-h> or <--help> parameter for more information.
Shell supports following meta-keys:

Ctrl+a, Ctrl+b, Ctrl+c, Ctrl+d, Ctrl+e, Ctrl+f, Ctrl+k, Ctrl+l, Ctrl+n, Ctrl+p, Ctrl+u, Ctrl+w
Alt+b, Alt+f.
Please refer to shell documentation for more details.

----

So after hitting _Tab_, we see that there are several interesting
commands we can use for additional information.

[source,console]
----
uart:~$ 
  clear       help        history     ieee802154  log         net
  resize      sample      shell
----

===== Zephyr Shell: IEEE 802.15.4 commands

Entering `ieee802154 help`, we see

[source,console]
----

  set_tx_power    :<-18/-7/-4/-2/0/1/2/3/5> Set TX power
----

We get the missing Channel number (frequency) with the command
`ieee802154 get_chan`.

[source,console]
----
uart:~$ ieee802154 get_chan
Channel 26
----

We get the missing PAN ID with the command `ieee802154 get_pan_id`.

[source,console]
----
uart:~$ ieee802154 get_pan_id
PAN ID 43981 (0xabcd)
----

===== Zephyr Shell: Network Commands

Additionally, we may query the IPv6 information of the Zephyr device.

[source,console]
----
uart:~$ net iface

Interface 0x20002b20 (IEEE 802.15.4) [1]
========================================
Link addr : CD:99:A1:1C:00:4B:12:00

IPv6 unicast addresses (max 3):
        fe80::cf99:a11c:4b:1200 autoconf preferred infinite
        2001:db8::1 manual preferred infinite
IPv6 multicast addresses (max 4):
        ff02::1
        ff02::1:ff4b:1200
        ff02::1:ff00:1
IPv6 prefixes (max 2):
        <none>
IPv6 hop limit           : 64
IPv6 base reachable time : 30000
IPv6 reachable time      : 16929
IPv6 retransmit timer    : 0
----

And we see that the static IPv6 address (`2001:db8::1`) from
`samples/net/sockets/echo_server/prj.conf` is present and configured.
While the statically configured IPv6 address is useful, it isn’t 100%
necessary.

== Rebuilding from source

#TODO: revisit everything below here

=== Prerequisites

* Zephyr environment is set up according to the
https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html[Getting
Started Guide]
** Please use the Zephyr SDK when installing a toolchain above
* https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html#install-a-toolchain[Zephyr
SDK] is installed at ~/zephyr-sdk-0.11.2 (any later version should be
fine as well)
* Zephyr board is connected via USB

=== Cloning the repository

This repository utilizes
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[git submodules] to keep
track of all of the projects required to reproduce the on-going work.
The instructions here only cover checking out the `demo` branch which
should stay in a tested state. On-going development will be on the
`master` branch.

NOTE: The parent directory `~` is simply used as a placeholder for testing.
Please use whatever parent directory you see fit.

==== Clone specific tag

[source,console]
----
cd ~
git clone --recurse-submodules --branch demo https://github.com/jadonk/beagleconnect

=== Zephyr

==== Add the Fork

For the time being, Greybus must remain outside of the main Zephyr
repository. Currently, it is just in a Zephyr fork, but it should be
converted to a proper
https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/modules.html[Module
(External Project)]. This is for a number of reasons, but mainly there
must be:

* specifications for authentication and encryption 
* specifications for joining and rejoining wireless networks 
* specifications for discovery

Therefore, in order to reproduce this example, please run the following.

NOTE: Open a separate terminal window (`Ctrl+Shift+N`) or simply create a
new tab in your existing terminal (`Ctrl+Shift+T`) so that you can see
both or quickly switch between `tio` and the shell.

=== Linux

WARNING: If you aren't comfortable building and installing a Linux kernel on your computer,
you should probably just stop here. I'll assume you know the basics of building and installing
a Linux kernel from here on out.

==== Clone, patch, and build the kernel
For this demo, I used the 5.8.4 stable kernel. Also, I've applied the `mikrobus` kernel
driver, though it isn't strictly required for greybus.

NOTE: Again, `~` is just used as a placeholder and you can use whatever directory you'd like.

#TODO: The patches for gb-netlink will eventually be applied here until pushed into mainline.#

[source,console]
----
cd ~
git clone --branch v5.8.4 --single-branch git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git

sudo make modules_install
sudo make install
----

Reboot and select your new kernel.

==== Probe the IEEE 802.15.4 Device Driver

On the Linux machine, make sure the `atusb` driver is loaded. This should happen automatically
when the adapter is inserted or when the machine is booted while the adapter is installed.

[source,console]

We should now be able to see the IEEE 802.15.4 network device by
entering `ip a show wpan0`.

----

But wait, that is not an IP address! It’s the hardware address of the
802.15.4 device. So, in order to associate it with an IP address, we
need to run a couple of other commands (thanks to
http://wpan.cakelab.org/[cakelab.org]).

=== Ping Pong

==== Broadcast Ping

Now, perform a broadcast ping to see what else is listening on
`lowpan0`.

Yay! We have pinged (pung?) the Zephyr device over IEEE 802.15.4 using
6LowPAN!

==== Ping Zephyr

course.

==== Assign a Static Address

So far, we have been using IPv6 Link-Local addressing. However, the
Zephyr application is configured to use a statically configured IPv6
address as well which is, namely `2001:db8::1`.

If we add a similar static IPv6 address to our Linux IEEE 802.15.4
network interface, `lowpan0`, then we should expect to be able to reach
that as well.

In Linux, run the following

[source,console]
----
sudo ip -6 addr add 2001:db8::2/64 dev lowpan0
----

We can verify that the address has been set by examining the `lowpan0`
network interface again.

[source,console]
----
$ ip a show lowpan0
37: lowpan0@wpan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1280 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/6lowpan 9e:0b:a4:e8:00:d3:45:53 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet6 2001:db8::2/64 scope global 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::9c0b:a4e8:d3:4553/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
----

Lastly, ping the statically configured IPv6 address of the Zephyr
device.

[source,console]
----
$ ping6 2001:db8::1
PING 2001:db8::1(2001:db8::1) 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 2001:db8::1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=53.7 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=13.1 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=22.0 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::1: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=22.7 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::1: icmp_seq=6 ttl=64 time=18.4 ms
----

Now that we have set up a reliable transport, let’s move on to the
application layer.

=== Greybus

Hopefully the videos listed earlier provide a sufficient foundation to
understand what will happen shortly. However, there is still a bit more
preparation required.

==== Build and probe Greybus Kernel Modules

Greybus was originally intended to work exclusively on the UniPro
physical layer. However, we’re using RF as our physical layer and TCP/IP
as our transport. As such, there was need to be able to communicate with
the Linux Greybus facilities through userspace, and out of that need
arose gb-netlink. The Netlink Greybus module actually does not care
about the physical layer, but is happy to usher Greybus messages back
and forth between the kernel and userspace.

Build and probe the gb-netlink modules (as well as the other Greybus
modules) with the following:

[source,console]
----
cd ${WORKSPACE}/sw/greybus
make -j`nproc --all`
sudo make install
../load_gb_modules.sh
----

==== Build and Run Gbridge

The gbridge utility was created as a proof of concept to abstract the
Greybus Netlink datapath among several reliable transports. For the
purposes of this tutorial, we’ll be using it as a TCP/IP bridge.

To run `gbridge`, perform the following:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install -y libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libbluetooth-dev libavahi-client-dev
cd gbridge
autoreconf -vfi
GBNETLINKDIR=${PWD}/../greybus \
  ./configure --enable-uart --enable-tcpip --disable-gbsim --enable-netlink --disable-bluetooth
make -j`nproc --all`
sudo make install
gbridge
----

=== Blinky!

Now that we have set up a reliable TCP transport, and set up the Greybus
modules in the Linux kernel, and used Gbridge to connect a Greybus node
to the Linux kernel via TCP/IP, we can now get to the heart of the
demonstration!

First, save the following script as `blinky.sh`.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
​
# Blinky Demo for CC1352R SensorTag
​
# /dev/gpiochipN that Greybus created
CHIP="$(gpiodetect | grep greybus_gpio | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}')"
​
# red, green, blue LED pins
RED=6
GREEN=7
BLUE=21
​
# Bash array for pins and values
PINS=($RED $GREEN $BLUE)
NPINS=${#PINS[@]}
​
for ((;;)); do
    for i in ${!PINS[@]}; do
        # turn off previous pin
        if [ $i -eq 0 ]; then
            PREV=2
        else
            PREV=$((i-1))
        fi
        gpioset $CHIP ${PINS[$PREV]}=0
​
        # turn on current pin
        gpioset $CHIP ${PINS[$i]}=1
​
        # wait a sec
        sleep 1
    done
done
----

Second, run the script with root privileges: `sudo bash blinky.sh`

The output of your minicom session should resemble the following.

=== Read I2C Registers

The SensorTag comes with an opt3001 ambient light sensor as well as an
hdc2080 temperature & humidity sensor.

First, find which i2c device corresponds to the SensorTag:

[source,bash]
----
ls -la /sys/bus/i2c/devices/* | grep "greybus"
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Aug 15 11:24 /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-8 -> ../../../devices/virtual/gb_nl/gn_nl/greybus1/1-2/1-2.2/1-2.2.2/gbphy2/i2c-8
----

On my machine, the i2c device node that Greybus creates is /dev/i2c-8.

Read the ID registers (at the i2c register address 0x7e) of the opt3001
sensor (at i2c bus address 0x44) as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
i2cget -y 8 0x44 0x7e w
0x4954
----

Read the ID registers (at the i2c register address 0xfc) of the hdc2080
sensor (at i2c bus address 0x41) as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
i2cget -y 8 0x41 0xfc w 
0x5449
----

=== Conclusion

The blinking LED can and poking i2c registers can be a somewhat
anticlimactic, but hopefully it illustrates the potential for Greybus as
an IoT application layer protocol.

What is nice about this demo, is that we’re using Device Tree to
describe our Greybus Peripheral declaratively, they Greybus Manifest is
automatically generated, and the Greybus Service is automatically
started in Zephyr.

In other words, all that is required to replicate this for other IoT
devices is simply an appropriate Device Tree overlay file.

The proof-of-concept involving Linux, Zephyr, and IEEE 802.15.4 was
actually fairly straight forward and was accomplished with mostly
already-upstream source.

For Greybus in Zephyr, there is still a considerable amount of
integration work to be done, including
* converting the fork to a proper
Zephyr module
* adding security and authentication
* automatic
detection, joining, and rejoining of devices

Thanks for reading, and we hope you’ve enjoyed this tutorial.
