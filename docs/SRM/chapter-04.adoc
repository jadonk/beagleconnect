== BeagleConnect™ greybus stack

[[work-in-progress]]
=== Work in progress

To understand a bit more about how the BeagleConnect™ Greybus stack is being built, this section helps describe the development currently in progress and the principles of operation.

==== Background

Proposition] BeagleConnect™ uses Greybus and updated Click Boards with
identifiers to eliminate the need to add and manually configure devices
added onto the Linux system.

==== High-level

* For Linux nerds: Think of BeagleConnect™ as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN[6LoWPAN] over
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4[802.15.4]-based
https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2015/talks/an-introduction-to-greybus/[Greybus]
(instead of Unipro as used by Project Ara), where every BeagleConnect™
board shows up as new SPI, I2C, UART, PWM, ADC, and GPIO controllers
that can now be probed to load drivers for the sensors or whatever is
connected to them. (Proof of concept of Greybus over TCP/IP:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H50pv-4YXw)
* For MCU folks: Think of BeagleConnect™ as a
https://github.com/firmata/protocol[Firmata]-style firmware load that
exposes the interfaces for remote access over a secured wireless
network. However, instead of using host software that knows how to speak
the Firmata protocol, the Linux kernel speaks the slightly similar
Greybus protocol to the MCU and exposes the device generically to users
using a Linux kernel driver. Further, the Greybus protocol is spoken
over https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN[6LoWPAN] on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4[802.15.4].

Cape
* Device tree fragments and driver updates can be provided via
https://bbb.io/click
* The Kconfig style provisioning can be implemented for those solutions,
which will require a reboot. We need to centralize edits to
/boot/uEnv.txt to be programmatic. As I think through this, I don't
think BeagleConnect is impacted, because the Greybus-style discovery
along with Click EEPROMS will eliminate any need to edit /boot/uEnv.txt.

User experience concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make sure no reboots are required
* Plugging BeagleConnect into host should trigger host configuration
* Click EEPROMs should trigger loading whatever drivers are needed and
provisioning should load any new drivers
* Userspace (spidev, etc.) drivers should unload cleanly when 2nd phase
provisioning is completed

[[demo-1]]
=== BeagleConnect™ Greybus demo using BeagleConnect™ Freedom
BeagleConnect™ Freedom runs a subGHz IEEE 802.15.4 network. This BeagleConnect™ Greybus demo shows how to interact with GPIO, I2C and mikroBUS add-on boards remotely connected over a BeagleConnect™ Freedom.

This section starts with the steps required to use
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux[Linux] embedded computer (https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/BeagleBone-Green-Gateway/[BeagleBone Green Gateway]) and the
https://lwn.net/Articles/715955/[Greybus] protocol, over an IEEE
802.15.4 wireless link, to blink an LED on a
https://zephyrproject.org[Zephyr] device.

=== Introduction

==== Why??

Good question. Blinking an LED is kind of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program[Hello, World]
of the hardware community. In this case, we’re less interested in the
mechanics of switching a GPIO to drive some current through an LED and
more interested in how that happens with the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things[Internet of Things
(IoT)].

There are several existing network and application layers that are
driven by corporate heavyweights and industry consortiums, but
relatively few that are community driven and, more specifically, even
fewer that have the ability to integrate so tightly with the Linux
kernel.

The goal here is to provide a community-maintained, developer-friendly,
and open-source protocol for the Internet of Things using the Greybus
Protocol, and blinking an LED using Greybus is the simplest
proof-of-concept for that. All that is required is a reliable transport.

1. Power a BeagleConnect Freedom that has not yet been programmed via a USB power source, not
the BeagleBone Green Gateway. You'll hear a click every 1-2 seconds along with seeing 4 of the
LEDs turn off and on.
2. In an isolated terminal window, `sudo beagleconnect-start-gateway`
3. `sensortest-rx.py`

Every 1-2 minutes, you should see something like:
```
('fe80::3111:7a22:4b:1200%lowpan0', 52213, 0, 13)  '2l:7.79;'
('fe80::3111:7a22:4b:1200%lowpan0', 52213, 0, 13)  '4h:43.75;4t:23.11;'
```

The value after "2l:" is the amount of light in lux. The value after "4h:" is the relative humidity and after "4t:" is the temperature in Celcius.

=== Flash BeagleConnect™ Freedom *node* device with Greybus firmware

#TODO: How can we add a step in here to show the network is connected without needing `gbridge` to be fully functional?

Do this from the BeagleBone® Green Gateway board that was previously used to program the BeagleConnect™ Freedom *gateway* device:

1. Disconnect the BeagleConnect™ Freedom *gateway* device
2. Connect a new BeagleConnect™ Freedom board via USB
3. `sudo systemctl stop lowpan.service`
4. `cc2538-bsl.py /usr/share/beagleconnect/cc1352/greybus_mikrobus_beagleconnect.bin /dev/ttyACM0`
footnote:[If the cc2538-bs1.py command fails, see Flashing via a Linux Host below]
5. After it finishes programming successfully, disconnect the BeagleConnect Freedom node device
6. Power the newly programmed BeagleConnect Freedom *node* device from an alternate USB power source
7. Reconnect the BeagleConnect Freedom *gateway* device to the BeagleBone Green Gateway
8. `sudo systemctl start lowpan.service`
9. `sudo beagleconnect-start-gateway`

```sh

#TODO: update the below for the built-in sensors

#TODO: can we also handle the case where these sensors are included and recommend them? Same firmware?

#TODO: the current demo is for the built-in sensors, not the Click boards mentioned below

Currently only a limited number of add-on boards have been tested to work over Greybus, simple add-on
boards without interrupt requirement are the ones that work currently.  The example is for
Air Quality 2 Click and Weather Click attached to the mikroBUS ports on the device side.

/var/log/gbridge will have the gbridge log, and if the mikroBUS port has been instantiated successfully the kernel log will show the devices probe messages:

#TODO: this log needs to be updated

#TODO: bring in the GPIO toggle and I2C explorations for greater understanding

=== Flashing via a Linux Host
If flashing the Freedom board via the BeagleBone fails here's a trick you can try to flash from a Linux host.

Use `sshfs` to mount the Bone's files on the Linux host.  This assumes the Bone is plugged in the the USB
and appears at `192.168.7.2`:

```
host$ cd
host$ sshfs 192.168.7.2:/ bone
host$ cd bone; ls
bin   dev  home    lib         media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
boot  etc  ID.txt  lost+found  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var
host$ ls /dev/ttyACM*
/dev/ttyACM1

```
The Bone's files now appear as local files.  Notice there is already a
`/dev/ACM` appearing.  Now plug the Connect into the Linux host's USB port
and run the command again.

```
host$ ls /dev/ttyACM*
/dev/ttyACM0  /dev/ttyACM1

```

The `/dev/ttyASM` that just appeared is the one associated with the Connect.
In my case it's `/dev/ttyACM0`.  That's what I'll use in this example.

Now change directories to where the binaries are and load:

```
host$ cd ~/bone/usr/share/beagleconnect/cc1352;ls
greybus_mikrobus_beagleconnect.bin     sensortest_beagleconnect.dts
greybus_mikrobus_beagleconnect.config  wpanusb_beagleconnect.bin
greybus_mikrobus_beagleconnect.dts     wpanusb_beagleconnect.config
sensortest_beagleconnect.bin           wpanusb_beagleconnect.dts
sensortest_beagleconnect.config

host$ ~/bone/usr/bin/cc2538-bsl.py sensortest_beagleconnect.bin /dev/ttyACM0
8-bsl.py sensortest_beagleconnect.bin /dev/ttyACM0

```

Now you are ready to continue the instructions above after the cc2528 command.

==== Trying for different add-on boards

See https://github.com/vaishnav98/greybus-for-zephyr/tree/mikrobus#trying-out-different-add-on-boardsdevices-over-mikrobus[mikroBUS over Greybus] for trying out the same example for different mikroBUS add-on boards/ on-board devices.

=== Observe the node device

Connect BeagleConnect Freedom node device to an Ubuntu laptop to observe the Zephyr console.

=== Console (`tio`)

In order to see diagnostic messages or to run certain commands on the
Zephyr device we will require a terminal open to the device console. In
this case, we use https://tio.github.io/[tio] due how its usage
simplifies the instructions.

==== Install `tio`

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install -y tio
----

==== Run `tio`

Now, we’ll open a terminal to Zephyr using the newly created setup with
the command below.

[source,console]
----
tio /dev/ttyACM0
----

IMPORTANT: To exit `tio` (later), enter `ctrl+t, q`.

=== The Zephyr Shell

After flashing, you should observe the something matching the following
output in `tio`.

....
uart:~$ *** Booting Zephyr OS build 9c858c863223  ***

....

The line beginning with `+++***+++` is the Zephyr boot banner.

Lines beginning with a timestamp of the form `[H:m:s.us]` are Zephyr
kernel messages.

Lines beginning with `uart:~$` indicates that the Zephyr shell is
prompting you to enter a command.

From the informational messages shown, we observe the following.

* Zephyr is configured with the following
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address#IPv6[link-local IPv6
address] `fe80::3177:a11c:4b:1200`
* It is listening for (both) TCP and UDP traffic on port 4242

However, what the log messages do _not_ show (which will come into play
later), are 2 critical pieces of information:

1. *The RF Channel*: As you
may have guessed, IEEE 802.15.4 devices are only able to communicate
with each other if they are using the same frequency to transmit and
recieve data. This information is part of the Physical Layer.
2. The
https://www.silabs.com/community/wireless/proprietary/knowledge-base.entry.html/2019/10/04/connect_tutorial6-ieee802154addressing-rapc[PAN
identifier]: IEEE 802.15.4 devices are only be able to communicate with
one another if they use the _same_ PAN ID. This permits multiple
networks (PANs) on the same frequency. This information is part of the
Data Link Layer.

If we type `help` in the shell and hit _Enter_, we’re prompted with the
following:

[source,console]
----
Please press the <Tab> button to see all available commands.
You can also use the <Tab> button to prompt or auto-complete all commands or its subcommands.
You can try to call commands with <-h> or <--help> parameter for more information.
Shell supports following meta-keys:

Ctrl+a, Ctrl+b, Ctrl+c, Ctrl+d, Ctrl+e, Ctrl+f, Ctrl+k, Ctrl+l, Ctrl+n, Ctrl+p, Ctrl+u, Ctrl+w
Alt+b, Alt+f.
Please refer to shell documentation for more details.

----

So after hitting _Tab_, we see that there are several interesting
commands we can use for additional information.

[source,console]
----
uart:~$ 
  clear       help        history     ieee802154  log         net
  resize      sample      shell
----

===== Zephyr Shell: IEEE 802.15.4 commands

Entering `ieee802154 help`, we see

[source,console]
----
uart:~$ ieee802154 help

  set_tx_power    :<-18/-7/-4/-2/0/1/2/3/5> Set TX power
----

We get the missing Channel number (frequency) with the command
`ieee802154 get_chan`.

[source,console]
----
uart:~$ ieee802154 get_chan
Channel 26
----

We get the missing PAN ID with the command `ieee802154 get_pan_id`.

[source,console]
----
uart:~$ ieee802154 get_pan_id
PAN ID 43981 (0xabcd)
----

===== Zephyr Shell: Network Commands

Additionally, we may query the IPv6 information of the Zephyr device.

[source,console]
----
uart:~$ net iface

Interface 0x20002b20 (IEEE 802.15.4) [1]
========================================
Link addr : CD:99:A1:1C:00:4B:12:00

IPv6 unicast addresses (max 3):
        fe80::cf99:a11c:4b:1200 autoconf preferred infinite
        2001:db8::1 manual preferred infinite
IPv6 multicast addresses (max 4):
        ff02::1
        ff02::1:ff4b:1200
        ff02::1:ff00:1
IPv6 prefixes (max 2):
        <none>
IPv6 hop limit           : 64
IPv6 base reachable time : 30000
IPv6 reachable time      : 16929
IPv6 retransmit timer    : 0
----

And we see that the static IPv6 address (`2001:db8::1`) from
`samples/net/sockets/echo_server/prj.conf` is present and configured.
While the statically configured IPv6 address is useful, it isn’t 100%
necessary.

=== Rebuilding from source

#TODO: revisit everything below here

=== Prerequisites

* Zephyr environment is set up according to the
https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html[Getting
Started Guide]
** Please use the Zephyr SDK when installing a toolchain above
* https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html#install-a-toolchain[Zephyr
SDK] is installed at ~/zephyr-sdk-0.11.2 (any later version should be
fine as well)
* Zephyr board is connected via USB

=== Cloning the repository

This repository utilizes
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[git submodules] to keep
track of all of the projects required to reproduce the on-going work.
The instructions here only cover checking out the `demo` branch which
should stay in a tested state. On-going development will be on the
`master` branch.

NOTE: The parent directory `~` is simply used as a placeholder for testing.
Please use whatever parent directory you see fit.

==== Clone specific tag

[source,console]
----
cd ~
git clone --recurse-submodules --branch demo https://github.com/jadonk/beagleconnect
----

=== Zephyr

==== Add the Fork

For the time being, Greybus must remain outside of the main Zephyr
repository. Currently, it is just in a Zephyr fork, but it should be
converted to a proper
https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/modules.html[Module
(External Project)]. This is for a number of reasons, but mainly there
must be:

* specifications for authentication and encryption 
* specifications for joining and rejoining wireless networks 
* specifications for discovery

Therefore, in order to reproduce this example, please run the following.

NOTE: Open a separate terminal window (`Ctrl+Shift+N`) or simply create a
new tab in your existing terminal (`Ctrl+Shift+T`) so that you can see
both or quickly switch between `tio` and the shell.

[source,console]
----
cd ~/beagleconnect/sw/zephyrproject/zephyr
west update

=== Linux

WARNING: If you aren't comfortable building and installing a Linux kernel on your computer,
you should probably just stop here. I'll assume you know the basics of building and installing
a Linux kernel from here on out.

==== Clone, patch, and build the kernel
For this demo, I used the 5.8.4 stable kernel. Also, I've applied the `mikrobus` kernel
driver, though it isn't strictly required for greybus.

NOTE: Again, `~` is just used as a placeholder and you can use whatever directory you'd like.

#TODO: The patches for gb-netlink will eventually be applied here until pushed into mainline.#

[source,console]
----
cd ~
git clone --branch v5.8.4 --single-branch git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
cd linux
git checkout -b v5.8.4-greybus
git am ~/beagleconnect/sw/linux/v2-0001-RFC-mikroBUS-driver-for-add-on-boards.patch
git am ~/beagleconnect/sw/linux/0001-mikroBUS-build-fixes.patch
cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
yes "" | make oldconfig
./scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh .config ~/beagleconnect/sw/linux/mikrobus.config
./scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh .config ~/beagleconnect/sw/linux/atusb.config
make -j`nproc --all`
sudo make modules_install
sudo make install
----

Reboot and select your new kernel.

==== Probe the IEEE 802.15.4 Device Driver

On the Linux machine, make sure the `atusb` driver is loaded. This should happen automatically
when the adapter is inserted or when the machine is booted while the adapter is installed.

[source,console]
----
$ dmesg | grep -i ATUSB

[    6.525357] usbcore: registered new interface driver atusb
...
----

We should now be able to see the IEEE 802.15.4 network device by
entering `ip a show wpan0`.

[source,console]
----
$ ip a show wpan0
36: wpan0: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 123 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 300
    link/ieee802.15.4 3e:7d:90:4d:8f:00:76:a2 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
----

But wait, that is not an IP address! It’s the hardware address of the
802.15.4 device. So, in order to associate it with an IP address, we
need to run a couple of other commands (thanks to
http://wpan.cakelab.org/[cakelab.org]).

. Next, set the Channel for the 802.15.4 device on the Linux machine
+
[source,console]
----
sudo iwpan phy phy0 set channel 0 26
----
+
. Then, set the PAN identifier for the 802.15.4 device on the Linux
machine `sudo iwpan dev wpan0 set pan_id 0xabcd` ## Create a
6LowPAN Network Interface
. Associate the `wpan0` device to a new, 6lowpan network interface
+
[source,console]
----
sudo ip link add link wpan0 name lowpan0 type lowpan
----
+
. Finally, set the links up for both `wpan0` and `lowpan0`
+
[source,console]
----
sudo ip link set wpan0 up
sudo ip link set lowpan0 up
----

We should observe something like the following when we run
`ip a show lowpan0`.

=== Ping Pong

==== Broadcast Ping

Now, perform a broadcast ping to see what else is listening on
`lowpan0`.

[source,console]
----
$ ping6 -I lowpan0 ff02::1

----

Yay! We have pinged (pung?) the Zephyr device over IEEE 802.15.4 using
6LowPAN!

==== Ping Zephyr

We can ping the Zephyr device directly without a broadcast ping too, of
course.

[source,console]
----
$ ping6 -I lowpan0 fe80::cf99:a11c:4b:1200

==== Ping Linux

Similarly, we can ping the Linux host from the Zephyr shell.

[source,console]

----

==== Assign a Static Address

So far, we have been using IPv6 Link-Local addressing. However, the
Zephyr application is configured to use a statically configured IPv6
address as well which is, namely `2001:db8::1`.

If we add a similar static IPv6 address to our Linux IEEE 802.15.4
network interface, `lowpan0`, then we should expect to be able to reach
that as well.

In Linux, run the following

[source,console]
----
sudo ip -6 addr add 2001:db8::2/64 dev lowpan0
----

We can verify that the address has been set by examining the `lowpan0`
network interface again.

[source,console]
----
$ ip a show lowpan0
37: lowpan0@wpan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1280 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/6lowpan 9e:0b:a4:e8:00:d3:45:53 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet6 2001:db8::2/64 scope global 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::9c0b:a4e8:d3:4553/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
----

Lastly, ping the statically configured IPv6 address of the Zephyr
device.

[source,console]
----
$ ping6 2001:db8::1
PING 2001:db8::1(2001:db8::1) 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 2001:db8::1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=53.7 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=13.1 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=22.0 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::1: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=22.7 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::1: icmp_seq=6 ttl=64 time=18.4 ms
----

Now that we have set up a reliable transport, let’s move on to the
application layer.

=== Greybus

Hopefully the videos listed earlier provide a sufficient foundation to
understand what will happen shortly. However, there is still a bit more
preparation required.

==== Build and probe Greybus Kernel Modules

Greybus was originally intended to work exclusively on the UniPro
physical layer. However, we’re using RF as our physical layer and TCP/IP
as our transport. As such, there was need to be able to communicate with
the Linux Greybus facilities through userspace, and out of that need
arose gb-netlink. The Netlink Greybus module actually does not care
about the physical layer, but is happy to usher Greybus messages back
and forth between the kernel and userspace.

Build and probe the gb-netlink modules (as well as the other Greybus
modules) with the following:

[source,console]
----
cd ${WORKSPACE}/sw/greybus
make -j`nproc --all`
sudo make install
../load_gb_modules.sh
----

==== Build and Run Gbridge

The gbridge utility was created as a proof of concept to abstract the
Greybus Netlink datapath among several reliable transports. For the
purposes of this tutorial, we’ll be using it as a TCP/IP bridge.

To run `gbridge`, perform the following:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install -y libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libbluetooth-dev libavahi-client-dev
cd gbridge
autoreconf -vfi
GBNETLINKDIR=${PWD}/../greybus \
  ./configure --enable-uart --enable-tcpip --disable-gbsim --enable-netlink --disable-bluetooth
make -j`nproc --all`
sudo make install
gbridge
----

=== Blinky!

Now that we have set up a reliable TCP transport, and set up the Greybus
modules in the Linux kernel, and used Gbridge to connect a Greybus node
to the Linux kernel via TCP/IP, we can now get to the heart of the
demonstration!

First, save the following script as `blinky.sh`.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
​
# Blinky Demo for CC1352R SensorTag
​
# /dev/gpiochipN that Greybus created
CHIP="$(gpiodetect | grep greybus_gpio | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}')"
​
# red, green, blue LED pins
RED=6
GREEN=7
BLUE=21
​
# Bash array for pins and values
PINS=($RED $GREEN $BLUE)
NPINS=${#PINS[@]}
​
for ((;;)); do
    for i in ${!PINS[@]}; do
        # turn off previous pin
        if [ $i -eq 0 ]; then
            PREV=2
        else
            PREV=$((i-1))
        fi
        gpioset $CHIP ${PINS[$PREV]}=0
​
        # turn on current pin
        gpioset $CHIP ${PINS[$i]}=1
​
        # wait a sec
        sleep 1
    done
done
----

Second, run the script with root privileges: `sudo bash blinky.sh`

The output of your minicom session should resemble the following.

==== Read I2C Registers

The SensorTag comes with an opt3001 ambient light sensor as well as an
hdc2080 temperature & humidity sensor.

First, find which i2c device corresponds to the SensorTag:

----

On my machine, the i2c device node that Greybus creates is /dev/i2c-8.

Read the ID registers (at the i2c register address 0x7e) of the opt3001
sensor (at i2c bus address 0x44) as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
i2cget -y 8 0x44 0x7e w
0x4954
----

Read the ID registers (at the i2c register address 0xfc) of the hdc2080
sensor (at i2c bus address 0x41) as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
i2cget -y 8 0x41 0xfc w 
0x5449
----

==== Conclusion

The blinking LED can and poking i2c registers can be a somewhat
anticlimactic, but hopefully it illustrates the potential for Greybus as
an IoT application layer protocol.

What is nice about this demo, is that we’re using Device Tree to
describe our Greybus Peripheral declaratively, they Greybus Manifest is
automatically generated, and the Greybus Service is automatically
started in Zephyr.

In other words, all that is required to replicate this for other IoT
devices is simply an appropriate Device Tree overlay file.

The proof-of-concept involving Linux, Zephyr, and IEEE 802.15.4 was
actually fairly straight forward and was accomplished with mostly
already-upstream source.

For Greybus in Zephyr, there is still a considerable amount of
integration work to be done, including
* converting the fork to a proper
Zephyr module
* adding security and authentication
* automatic
detection, joining, and rejoining of devices
